# Customers

A Customer represents an individual or business with whom you intend to transact with and is programmatically created and managed by a Dwolla account via the API. In order for a Dwolla `Account` to create and manage Customers, an OAuth access token with the `ManageCustomers` OAuth scope is required.

<ol class="alerts">
    <li class="alert icon-alert-info">This section outlines functionality for [Dwolla White Label](https://www.dwolla.com/white-label), a premium product that only approved partners may access in production. To learn more about entering into a White Label agreement, please [contact Sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs).</li>
</ol>

### Verified and unverified Customers

With a transfer of money, at least one party must complete the identity verification process, either the sender or the receiver. It’s your decision about which party completes this process, based on your business model, and you may want to have both parties complete the identity verification process. In cases where a Customer is sending funds to or receiving funds from your account, the Customer can remain unverified because your account is already verified. However, if you need to transfer funds between your Customers, at least one of them will need to be verified.

For more information on white label account types, reference the [account types](https://developers.dwolla.com/resources/account-types/white-label-accounts.html) resource article.

### Receive-only
Receive-only customers are restricted to a "payouts only" business model. A receive-only customer maintains limited functionality in the API and is only eligible to receive transfers to an attached bank account from the Dwolla `Account` that created it.

### Migrating Dwolla user Accounts to White Label Customers
Dwolla offers a seamless process for migrating existing user [Accounts](#accounts) managed via OAuth on your platform to White Label [Customers](#customers). The user Account will maintain existing functionality on dwolla.com and will act as a separate White Label Customer upon completion of the migration. To learn more about upgrading to White Label, please [contact Sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs).

## Create a Customer

This section details how to create a new Customer.  To create an unverified Customer, you need to provide only the customer's full name and email address.  Verified Customers require additional information that will give Dwolla the ability to confirm the identity of the individual or business. Verified Customers can include type `business` or `personal`. For businesses, Dwolla will need to verify information about both the business and the “authorized representative” for that business. For receive-only customers, you'll provide the customer's full name, `type` with the value of `receive-only`, and `businessName` if applicable.

For more information on verified Customers, reference our [Customer verification](https://developers.dwolla.com/resources/customer-verification.html) resource article.

</ol>

### HTTP request

##### Request parameters -  unverified Customer
Parameter | Optional? | Description
----------|----------|-------------

### Upgrade an unverified Customer to verified Customer
An unverified Customer can be upgraded to a verified Customer by supplying the necessary information required to create a verified Customer. See [this table](#request-parameters-verified-customer) for required information.

An unverified and verified Customer can be suspended by supplying the status of `suspended`. You'll need to contact Dwolla to unsuspend a Customer.

## Create on-demand transfer authorization

This section outlines how to create an on-demand bank transfer authorization for your Customer. On-demand authorization allows Customers to authorize Dwolla to transfer variable amounts from their bank account using ACH at a later point in time for products or services delivered. This on-demand authorization is supplied along with the Customer's bank details when creating a [new Customer funding source](#new-customer-funding-source).

When on-demand authorization is enabled for your application the Customer is presented with text on a “add bank account” screen in your user interface(UI) giving authorization to Dwolla for future variable payments. **Note:** On-demand payments come as part of our White Label product and requires additional approval before getting started. Please [contact Sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs) for more information on enabling.

## Create a Customer funding source
There are two methods available for adding a bank or credit union account to a Customer. You can either collect the Customer's bank account information and pass it to Dwolla via the [new Customer funding source](#new-customer-funding-source) endpoint, or you can send the Customer through the the [Instant Account Verification](#instant-account-verification-iav) (IAV) flow which will add and verify a bank account within seconds.

Before a Dwolla account or white label Customer is eligible to transfer money from their bank or credit union account they need to verify ownership of the account, either via Instant Account Verification (IAV) or micro-deposits. For more information on bank account verification, reference this [funding source verification](https://developers.dwolla.com/resources/funding-source-verification.html) resource article.

### New Customer funding source
Create a new Funding Source for a Customer.  Customers can have a maximum of 6 funding sources.

### Instant account verification (IAV)
IAV is a simple and secure process which requires both server-side and client-side interaction. Your server requests a [single-use token](#generate-an-iav-token) which is used to represent the Customer that is adding or verifying their bank. The client-side implementation includes the dwolla.js library on the page that is used to render the IAV flow.

```javascriptnoselect
<script src="https://cdn.dwolla.com/1/dwolla.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  dwolla.configure('sandbox');
  dwolla.iav.start('container', token.value, function(err, res) {
    console.log('Error: ' + JSON.stringify(err) + ' -- Response: ' + JSON.stringify(res))
  })
</script>
```

<ol class="alerts">
    <li class="alert icon-alert-alert">An [IAV token](#generate-an-iav-token) is required to render the IAV flow.</li>
</ol>

#### dwolla.js
`dwolla.js` is a JavaScript library that gives you the ability to render the IAV flow within a specified container. Call the function `dwolla.iav.start()` and pass the following arguments: the container where you want IAV to render, the Customer's single-use [IAV token](#generate-an-iav-token), and a callback to handle the `response` or `error`. This will initiate an HTTP request asking Dwolla to load IAV in the specified container. Once the Customer successfully completes the IAV flow, Dwolla sends a response that includes either an error or a link to the newly created and verified funding source resource.

#### Usage and configuration

##### Include dwolla.js

**Development version:**
`<script src="https://cdn.dwolla.com/1/dwolla.js"></script>`

## Cancel a Customer's transfer by id

When a Customer's bank transfer is eligible for cancellation, Dwolla returns a `cancel` link  when [getting the transfer by Id](#get-a-transfer-by-id). This cancel link is used to trigger the cancellation, preventing the bank transfer from processing further. A bank transfer is cancellable up until 4pm CT on that same business day if initiated prior to 4PM CT. If a transfer was initiated after 4pm CT, it can be cancelled anytime before 4pm CT on the following business day.
