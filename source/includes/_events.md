# Events

When the state of a resource changes, we create a new event resource to record the change.  For instance, if a Customer's status changes to `verified`, a `customer_verified` event will be created.  When an Event is created, a [Webhook](#webhooks) will be created to deliver the Event to any URLs specified by your active [Webhook Subscriptions](#webhook-subscriptions).
