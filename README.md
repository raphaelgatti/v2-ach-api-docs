About Dwolla
========

Dwolla is a software platform that makes it easy to move money between banks. When using Dwolla APIs your software platform can move money between any 2 bank accounts, or network members, with no transaction fees.

Our software platform is compatible with all banks in the United States. The developer documents are designed to support our development partners who are building on top of Dwolla’s branded platform (v1) or our white labeled infrastructure (v2).

The Dwolla API developer portal lives here: https://developers.dwolla.com/

Our API portal is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/Dwolla/open-source-developer-portal

About the v2 Developer Docs
------------------------------

The v2 API docs are built on Slate. Our modifications are also available to the community.

About the v2 API
------------------------------

The initial focus of API Version 2 centers around a premium product: white label, and provides different functionality from API Version 1. Over time, we are adding the same functionality currently available in V1 to V2.

Official SDKs for Java, Node.JS, PHP, Ruby, and Python are being actively developed.

Getting Started 
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

 1. Fork this repository on Github.
 2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/slate.git`
 3. `cd slate`
 4. Install all dependencies: `bundle install`
 5. Start the test server: `bundle exec middleman server`

Or use the included Dockerfile! (must install Docker first)

```shell
docker build -t slate .
docker run -d -p 4567:4567 slate
```

You can now see the docs at <http://localhost:4567>. Whoa! That was fast!

*Note: if you're using the Docker setup on OSX, the docs will be
availalable at the output of `boot2docker ip` instead of `localhost:4567`.*

Now that Slate is all set up your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).
