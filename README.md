Documentation for Dwolla's v2 API built on Slate
========

Documentation is reflected here - https://docsv2.dwolla.com/

Getting Started 
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

 1. Fork this repository on Github.
 2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/slate.git`
 3. `cd slate`
 4. Install all dependencies: `bundle install`
 5. Start the test server: `bundle exec middleman server`

Or use the included Dockerfile! (must install Docker first)

```shell
docker build -t slate .
docker run -d -p 4567:4567 slate
```

You can now see the docs at <http://localhost:4567>. Whoa! That was fast!

*Note: if you're using the Docker setup on OSX, the docs will be
availalable at the output of `boot2docker ip` instead of `localhost:4567`.*

Now that Slate is all set up your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).
